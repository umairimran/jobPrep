Data Ware Housing


The compelling need for data warehousing:
Integrity
Accessible
Credible
Timely




Chapter 2 :
Data Warehousing The Building Blocks

Approach must be cleared in mind that whether to use top down approach or bottom up approach whether to make datamarts or dataware house

Enterprise level or departmental level
Which first dm or dw?
Build with pilot go or full fledge implementation?
Dependent or independent datamarts?


Top down approach :
  Advantages:
Truely corporate big
architexted correctly not a union of disperate data marts
single , central storage
centralized rules and control
make quick results if implemented
  Disadvantages:
Takes longer to build
high risk
need cross functional fkills
high outlay without proof of concept


Bottom Up Approach: first make dm then dw
	Advantages:
faster  and easier
favorable return on investment
less risk
incremental
allow project team to learn

	Disadvanteges:
Narrow less view of data
redundant data
inconsistent data
unmanageable interfaces





Centralized :
no dm
summary of overall data
source_data->staging->storage->delivery

Independant DM:
Redundant and inconsistent data
source->staging->multiple DM to store -> delivery


Federated :
DM->delivery

Hub And Spoke:
source->staging->storage in dw -> dm->delivery

Data Mart Bus:



Source data components: Four components or four types or sources
External: From outer sources like competitors a analysis
Production: From OLTP
Internal: Private spreadsheets documents
Archived:Old data that has been saved in companies database.



Data Staging component:

Data Extraction:

Data transformation
Data Loading 
Data Storage Component
Information delivery component

1. Name at least six characteristics or features of a data warehouse.
For specific domain orgnation subject oriented 
Data is integrated from all departments in single place
Non volatile not frequent changes just add data remove according to req
Ad hoc access for quering and reporting
supports olap system


2. Why is data integration required in a data warehouse, more so than in an operational
application?
-Combinaing data from many sources
-Ensure data consistency
- For analysis
-For fast reporting
-Creating a Single Source of Truth



3. Every data structure in the data warehouse contains the time element. Why?

Bcz we need to analysize according  to time in market analysis






4. Explain data granularity and how it is applicable to the data warehouse.

Data granularity in a data warehouse refers to the level of detail in the data stored, ranging from highly detailed (e.g., individual transactions) to aggregated summaries (e.g., monthly sales totals). It affects performance, storage, and analysis: detailed data supports in-depth, transactional analysis, while aggregated data facilitates quicker, high-level reporting and trend analysis. Balancing granularity is crucial for optimizing query performance and storage efficiency, allowing a data warehouse to provide both detailed insights and summarized overviews based on user needs.


5. How are the top-down and bottom-up approaches for building a data warehouse differ-
ent? List the major types of architectures and highlight the features of any two of these.



6. What are the various data sources for the data warehouse?

7. Why do you need a separate data staging component?
Data Cleansing
Data Aggregation
Data Normalization
Data Enrichment
Data Filtering

8-Name any six diffent methods for information delivery?
Reports
Dashboards
Data Visualization
Interactive Queries
Alerts and Notifications
Ad Hoc Analysis

9- types of meta data:

Operational metadata
† Extraction and transformation metadata
† End-user metadata
