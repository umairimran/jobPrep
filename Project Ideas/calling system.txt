1. Project Overview
The AI outbound calling system is a web-based platform designed to automate and manage outbound calls. The platform operates on an agent-based model, where agents (resellers or authorized partners) are licensed to use the software. The system leverages AI technology to handle large-scale sales, customer service, surveys, and reminder calls. Agents must complete business certification to gain access, and the platform charges agents a service fee based on their usage.
